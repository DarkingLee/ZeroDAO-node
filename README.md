# ZeroDAO-node

We define ZeroDAO as a public resource, including a social network, a reputation system. the ZeroDAO social network solves the incentive dilemma that currently exists in blockchain social networks, while incentivizing good behavior makes good behavior disappear. Imagine what Twitter would look like if you could get $1 for posting a tweet. Two-factor theory even concludes that security, salary, fringe benefits, good pay is not Motivators but Hygiene factors. Hygiene factors that do not give positive satisfaction or lead to higher motivation.

ZeroDAO social network solves the incentive dilemma by amplifying social motivation and internalizing external motivation.

In the ZeroDAO network, we still quantify user contributions and settle them into Tokens, which we call social currency. It is frozen and at some point assigned to users trusted by the owner, it is also social currency and goes on to be shared. The user's social motivation is amplified. We use to shared information, now we share value.

ZeroDAO social network brought us the reputation system and we proposed the TIR algorithm to compute the graph and obtain the reputation of each user. TIR is difficult to compute but easy to verify on-chain. This feature makes ZeroDAO's reputation system completely decentralized. At the same time, it has strong ability to prevent Sybil Attack to meet the security needs of financial products and on-chain governance. ZeroDAO also brings credit finance, zero-cost payments, and other applications to the blockchain.

## WARNING

The ZeroDAO-node is still in the early stages of development.Important features are missing. Please don't build any serious projects with ZeroDAO-node.
